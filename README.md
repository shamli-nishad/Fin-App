# Financial Management Tool

## Overview
The Financial Management Tool is a comprehensive web application designed to help individuals manage their finances efficiently. Built with a modern microservices architecture using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Maven, this application provides a range of features to track expenses, set budgets, analyze financial habits, and generate reports. The architecture is designed to be extendable, allowing for future development into mobile applications.

## Key Features
- **User Management:** Secure user authentication and profile management to ensure that each user's financial data is private and accessible only to them.
- **Transaction Tracking:** Real-time tracking of income, expenses, and transactions with detailed categorization and reporting.
- **Budgeting:** Tools to set and manage budgets, track progress towards financial goals, and monitor spending against budget limits.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate detailed financial reports and visualizations to provide insights into spending patterns and financial health.
- **Notifications:** Customizable alerts and notifications for important events, such as nearing a budget limit or unusual spending activity.
- **Security:** Robust security measures, including OAuth2-based authentication and secure communication between microservices.

## Architecture
The application is built using a microservices architecture, ensuring that each component is independent, scalable, and maintainable. Key components include:

- **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice and providing functionalities such as load balancing, authentication, and rate limiting.
- **Service Registry:** Manages service discovery, allowing microservices to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding network locations.
- **Configuration Server:** Centralized configuration management, ensuring consistent configuration across all microservices.
- **Microservices:** Each microservice handles a specific business capability:
- **User Service:** Manages user profiles and authentication.
- **Transaction Service:** Handles all financial transactions and expense categorization.
- **Budgeting Service:** Allows users to set and monitor budgets.
- **Reporting Service:** Generates financial reports and analytics.
- **Notification Service:** Manages user notifications and alerts.
- **Logging and Tracing:** Integrated logging and tracing for monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms to handle failures gracefully.
- **Security:** Comprehensive security layer to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Maven
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL (can be configured based on environment)
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Service Registry:** Eureka
- **Configuration Management:** Spring Cloud Config Server
- **Logging and Monitoring:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana with Loki
- **Containerization and Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (for deployment and scaling)

## Future Roadmap
- **Mobile App Development:** Extend the functionality to mobile platforms using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporate machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and personalized financial advice.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrate with external financial services (e.g., banks, credit cards) for automated transaction tracking and more comprehensive financial insights.
