# Financial Management Tool

## Overview
The Financial Management Tool is a comprehensive web application designed to help individuals manage their finances efficiently. Built with a modern microservices architecture using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Maven, this application provides a range of features to track expenses, set budgets, analyze financial habits, and generate reports. The architecture is designed to be extendable, allowing for future development into mobile applications.

## Key Features
- **User Management:** Secure user authentication and profile management to ensure that each user's financial data is private and accessible only to them.
- **Transaction Tracking:** Real-time tracking of income, expenses, and transactions with detailed categorization and reporting.
- **Budgeting:** Tools to set and manage budgets, track progress towards financial goals, and monitor spending against budget limits.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate detailed financial reports and visualizations to provide insights into spending patterns and financial health.
- **Notifications:** Customizable alerts and notifications for important events, such as nearing a budget limit or unusual spending activity.
- **Security:** Robust security measures, including OAuth2-based authentication and secure communication between microservices.

## Architecture
The application is built using a microservices architecture, ensuring that each component is independent, scalable, and maintainable. Key components include:

- **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice and providing functionalities such as load balancing, authentication, and rate limiting.
- **Service Registry:** Manages service discovery, allowing microservices to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding network locations.
- **Configuration Server:** Centralized configuration management, ensuring consistent configuration across all microservices.
- **Microservices:** Each microservice handles a specific business capability:
    - **User Service:** Manages user profiles and authentication.
    - **Transaction Service:** Handles all financial transactions and expense categorization.
    - **Budgeting Service:** Allows users to set and monitor budgets.
    - **Reporting Service:** Generates financial reports and analytics.
    - **Notification Service:** Manages user notifications and alerts.
- **Logging and Tracing:** Integrated logging and tracing for monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms to handle failures gracefully.
- **Security:** Comprehensive security layer to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Maven
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL (can be configured based on environment)
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Service Registry:** Eureka
- **Configuration Management:** Spring Cloud Config Server
- **Logging and Monitoring:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana with Loki
- **Containerization and Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (for deployment and scaling)

## Future Roadmap
- **Mobile App Development:** Extend the functionality to mobile platforms using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporate machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and personalized financial advice.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrate with external financial services (e.g., banks, credit cards) for automated transaction tracking and more comprehensive financial insights.

# Deploying Spring Boot Microservices on Azure

This document provides an overview of different ways to deploy Spring Boot microservices on Azure, ranging from simple VM deployment to advanced PaaS and containerized solutions.

---

## 1. Deploying on a Virtual Machine (VM)

### Overview
Deploying a Spring Boot microservice on a VM provides full control over the environment but requires manual management of infrastructure, scaling, and deployment.

### Steps

1. **Set Up the VM**
   - Provision a VM using a cloud provider (e.g., Azure VM).
   - Choose an OS (Linux or Windows).
   - Install necessary software, including Java.

2. **Prepare the Spring Boot Application**
   - Build your Spring Boot application into a JAR/WAR file using Maven or Gradle.

3. **Transfer the Application to the VM**
   - Upload the JAR/WAR file to the VM using SCP, SFTP, or other file transfer tools.

4. **Run the Application**
   - SSH into the VM and run the application using:
     ```bash
     java -jar myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```

5. **Configure VM for Continuous Availability**
   - Use a process manager like `systemd` to ensure the application starts automatically on VM reboot.

6. **Configure Networking**
   - Open necessary ports on the VMâ€™s firewall.
   - Access the application via `http://your-vm-ip:8080`.

7. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up monitoring tools and configure logging.

## 2. Deploying on Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

### Overview
Azure PaaS options, like Azure App Service, simplify the deployment and management of applications by abstracting underlying infrastructure.

### Steps

1. **Create an Azure App Service**
   - Use Azure Portal to create a new App Service.
   - Select the runtime stack (Java), operating system, and region.

2. **Deploy the Spring Boot Application**
   - Deploy the JAR/WAR file via Azure CLI, FTP, or Git.

3. **Configure Application Settings**
   - Set environment variables and connection strings in Azure Portal.

4. **Monitor and Scale Your Application**
   - Enable Application Insights for monitoring.
   - Configure scaling options based on load.

5. **Access Your Application**
   - Access your Spring Boot application via the provided Azure App Service URL.

## 3. Advanced Deployment Options

### Overview
For more complex and scalable deployments, Azure provides advanced services like AKS, Azure Spring Apps, and Azure Functions.

### 3.1 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

- **Why AKS?**: Best for managing large-scale, containerized microservices architectures.
- **Steps**:
  1. Containerize your Spring Boot application using Docker.
  2. Deploy the container to AKS using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
  3. Use Kubernetes tools for scaling and management.

### 3.2 Azure Spring Apps (formerly Azure Spring Cloud)

- **Why Azure Spring Apps?**: Ideal for Spring Boot applications with built-in support for microservices features.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create an Azure Spring Apps service instance.
  2. Deploy your Spring Boot application using Azure CLI or the Azure Portal.
  3. Utilize built-in monitoring and scaling features.

### 3.3 Azure Functions with Spring Cloud Function

- **Why Azure Functions?**: Suitable for event-driven, serverless microservices.
- **Steps**:
  1. Develop a Spring Cloud Function application.
  2. Deploy it to Azure Functions using the Azure Maven Plugin or CLI.
  3. Manage and scale automatically based on demand.

### 3.4 Azure Container Instances (ACI)

- **Why ACI?**: Simplified container deployment without managing VMs or orchestrators.
- **Steps**:
  1. Containerize your application and push it to Azure Container Registry.
  2. Deploy to ACI using Azure CLI.
  3. Access and monitor the running application via the provided IP.

### 3.5 Azure App Service with Docker

- **Why Use Docker with Azure App Service?**: Combines managed hosting with container flexibility.
- **Steps**:
  1. Containerize your Spring Boot application.
  2. Deploy to Azure App Service with Docker support.
  3. Manage and scale via Azure Portal or CLI.

## Summary

- **VM Deployment**: Full control over infrastructure but requires manual management.
- **PaaS Deployment (Azure App Service)**: Simplifies deployment with managed hosting.
- **Advanced Options (AKS, Azure Spring Apps, Azure Functions, ACI)**: Best for complex, scalable microservices architectures, offering more flexibility and advanced features.
